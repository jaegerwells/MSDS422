## Executive Summary

Online news and social media have become a dominant force in our society today. "Going viral" or shareability is how people learn about world events. While news feels like it is unbalanced and incredible negative most of the time, there is a need to explore what are the attributes of articles that drive shareability. By utilizing data from over 2 years from the website Mashable, we will look to understand what are the characteristics of a news article going viral.

## Problem Statement / Research Objectives

Our problem statement is simple; What are the characteristics that make news go viral? We will look to understand if subjectivity, overall polarity, channel news is being displayed, and type of file format for news impacts the total number of shares on Mashable.
